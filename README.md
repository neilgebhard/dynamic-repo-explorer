# Dynamic Repo Explorer

A full-stack application for exploring GitHub repositories dynamically.

## Getting Started

1. Install client dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client && npm install
   ```

2. Install service dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../service && npm install
   ```

3. Start the service in `/service`:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. In a new terminal, start the client in `/client`:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The client will run on `http://localhost:3000` and the service on `http://localhost:3001`.

To run tests, use `npm run test` in `/client`.

## Development Notes

**AI Usage**:

I built this project using Claude AI as a development tool. I used AI to plan out tasks, add boilerplate, debug errors, and assist with styling. I stayed hands-on throughout, writing code myself, tweaking and modifying AI-generated suggestions, making architectural decisions, and ensuring all code met my standards and followed the project requirements. As always, I reviewed and curated any AI-generated code before adding it to the project. This reflects how I work. It's understood by me that AI is a solid pair programming tool, but I fully own and understand everything that goes into my code.
